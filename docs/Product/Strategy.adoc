== Implement product roadmaps

Roadmaps are representations of strategy, used to bring:

* Control to development efforts
* Clarity to relevant stakeholders.

In implementation, they're a manually curated list of tickets from a <<../Practice/IT Infrastructure and Tools#table-product-backlogs,Strategy backlog>>, possibly also including ones from Projects/Product backlogs.

A way to implement that would be to tag tickets with `Roadmap`, then querying for these, and presenting the results as a table or Gantt chart.
