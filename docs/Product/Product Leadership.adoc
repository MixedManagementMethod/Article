== Verify you have product leadership

Like other forms of leadership, the essence of product leadership is simply the ability to:

* Understand 'here', <<../Practice/Communication#communication,communicate>> it at high to low levels to different audiences using different mediums.
* Define a vision of 'there'
* Understand how to get from here to there
* Communicate how to get from here to there
* Execute

If you find, after investigation, that product leadership isn't in your organization, you need to understand why and how to remedy it.

It's essential that your organization has <<../People/Leadership#foster-leadership-reject-management,competent leaders that actually value understanding the product>>.
